GBS XML Data Imports
====================

XML Import Files

To import this information into a WordPress site follow these steps:

1. Log in to that site as an administrator.

2. Go to Tools: Import in the WordPress admin panel.

3. Install the "WordPress" importer from the list.

4. Activate & Run Importer.

5. Upload the XML file using the form provided on that page.

6. You will first be asked to map the author in this export file (admin) to a user on the site. You may choose to map to an existing user on the site or to create a new user.

7. You should choose to import attachments if you'd like images for your data, though this will add to the time it takes to import.

8. WordPress will then import each of the deals, merchants, images, categories, etc. contained in the XML file into your site.
